  <h6>Top of hobbies</h6>
  <p>Downtime is important. We all need it, and many of us are on a mission to find more of it and figure out just how to spend it. Whether you’re looking for a new hobby, or you want to see if your favorite pastime made our top 10 list, we’re
    sharing the 10 most popular hobbies enjoyed around the world.</p>
  <h2><span id="What_Are_The_Most_Popular_Hobbies_in_the_World">What Are The Most Popular Hobbies in the World?</span></h2>
  <h3><span id="1_Reading">1. Reading</span></h3>
  <p>If your idea of a fun Friday night is cozying up with a book, you’re certainly not alone. Reading is enjoyed worldwide; it’s accessible due to the fact that it’s inexpensive (or free), and it allows people to explore new and exciting worlds, and
    expand their knowledge.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is always a new and exciting book to read and once you have finished reading, there is nothing nicer than lending it to a friend. This hobby certainly isn’t a new one, but it sure is a goodie! </span></p>
  <h3><span id="2_Traveling">2. Traveling</span></h3>
  <p>Whether it’s a trip across the ocean or exploring the next town over, traveling is an exciting hobby virtually anyone can participate in. From the planning stage to the trip itself, traveling gives folks something to look forward to, along with
    a brief escape from reality. Plus, the memories last a lifetime.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I really like traveling because it doesn’t have to cost an arm and a leg. If you are strapped for cash, you can couch surf and backpack all while visiting your favorite places. </span></p>
  <h3><span id="3_Fishing">3. Fishing</span></h3>
  <p>If you need a break from the daily grind, unwind with a fishing trip. Whether you’re <a href="https://hobbyhelp.com/fishing/" rel="">fishing for food or just for fun</a>, the hobby is a great way to relax and enjoy nature. There are many
    different types of fishing, making the hobby accessible in most places. If you’re looking for a challenge, try <a href="https://hobbyhelp.com/fishing/ice-fishing/" rel="">ice fishing</a> or fishing on a stand-up paddleboard.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also turn it into a family activity and bring your friends and family along. Set up a picnic table and bring your favorite food and enjoy the experience!</span></p>
  <h3><span id="4_Crafting">4. Crafting</span></h3>
  <p>Creativity is universal, and so is the art of crafting. There are many avenues crafters can take, from <a href="https://hobbyhelp.com/knitting/" rel="">knitting</a> and crochet to paper crafts and beading. The internet has opened up a whole new
    world to craft enthusiasts everywhere; if supplies can’t be found locally, they can easily be found online. Craft websites and message boards offer inspiration when creativity is running low.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can work on your art and crafts projects and designs from the comfort of your living room with a cold glass of wine or attend a craft class nearby; that is the beauty of this hobby!</span></p>
  <h3><span id="5_Television">5. Television</span></h3>
  <p>One of the most popular hobbies worldwide is television. The hobby has changed dramatically in recent years; many networks offer endless on-demand viewing options, and because watching television doesn’t require much effort, it’s an activity
    that many people partake in daily.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Watching TV is something that people don’t usually put into the hobby category, maybe because we do it so frequently that we forget that it is a pastime. Watching television can also be educational, with certain
      programs showing informative content that is quite frankly absolutely fascinating. </span></p>
  <h3><span id="6_Bird_Watching">6. Bird Watching</span></h3>
  <p>This hobby continues to grow in popularity, thanks to the fact that virtually anyone can participate. <a href="https://hobbyhelp.com/bird-watching/" rel="">Bird watching</a>, otherwise known as “birding,” doesn’t require much equipment. The
    hobby draws people young and old, making it an excellent intergenerational activity.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being outside in the wilderness is also incredibly positive for your mental state, so bird watching can have a very positive impact on you in many ways. You can make this activity last all day by taking a book,
      food, and tent with you, or you can take a quick half-hour stroll to bird watch before you need to leave for work; that is the beauty of this hobby! </span></p>
  <h3><span id="7_Collecting">7. Collecting</span></h3>
  <p>There’s comfort in being surrounded by the things we love, which is one reason why collecting is such a popular activity. From <a href="https://hobbyhelp.com/pokemon-cards/" rel="">pokemon cards</a> and <a
      href="https://hobbyhelp.com/coin-collecting/" rel="">coins</a> to action figures and dolls, there are countless collecting options.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some collectible items are difficult to find, which makes the hobby that much more interesting. Take coin collecting for example; you may need to travel to find your next coin, which adds to the adventure and
      excitement. </span></p>
  <h3><span id="8_Music">8. Music</span></h3>
  <p>Played, heard, and loved worldwide, music brings people together. Whether it’s listening at home or taking in a concert, music can be enjoyed anywhere.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Music lovers can even dabble in making music too, which is a hobby in itself. All of the top music producers and artists started their musical journey as a hobby, so who knows, you might end up being the next big
      thing! </span></p>
  <h3><span id="9_Gardening">9. Gardening</span></h3>
  <p>Many people <a href="https://diygarden.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">work in the garden</a> to produce food, while others appreciate that it passes the time and offers a sense of accomplishment. Some folks enjoy giving others
    food from their gardens, and others sell produce for extra cash.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don’t have a large outdoor space, you can still take part. If you have a small balcony, you can plant your plants in small pots or hanging baskets, and if you don’t have an outside space at all, you can
      care for houseplants. </span></p>
  <h3><span id="10_Video_Games">10. Video Games</span></h3>
  <p>Sure, video games get a bad rap, but let’s face it… people love them! There are games to suit virtually any personality and preference. Online gaming allows gamers to connect with others online.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People of all ages can play video games; just make sure you get an age-appropriate game that is suitable for you and enjoy! If you have trouble sleeping, playing video games can help pass the time, especially at
      night where there isn’t much else you could do! </span></p>
  <h2><span id="Common_Hobbies_During_Pandemic">Common Hobbies During Pandemic</span></h2>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020 was a tough year. We all learned a lot about ourselves and tackled many financial, social, and personal problems on our own. If you were used to being a social butterfly, isolations and lock-downs probably
      turned your world upside down. </span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With all of the doom and gloom that the global pandemic brought came wonderful reinventions and newfound hope. We learned and are still learning things about ourselves during this pandemic. </span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social distancing has made us appreciate the importance of human interaction, but it has also made us comfortable being in our own company, something that otherwise might have been impossible to teach. </span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What have we all been doing with our free time? We have all been very busy, I tell you! Take a look at the following hobbies to find out what hobbies are popular in a pandemic.</span><span

    </span></p>
  <h3><span id="11_Yoga">11. Yoga</span></h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yoga is a mind and body activity that is great for building muscle and helps you work on your balance, concentration, and core strength. The beauty of yoga is that it can be done anywhere; you don’t need to go to
      a gym to do yoga, and you don’t need fancy equipment either. If the weather is nice, you can even do your yoga exercises outside. </span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yoga is a sport with plenty of difficulty levels and moves to suit your abilities. Beginners can ease into the sport by following simple steps and gradually increase the level of difficulty as time goes on.
    </span></p>
  <h3><span id="12_Arts_and_Crafts">12. Arts and Crafts</span></h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arts and crafts projects can be big or small, and the best part about it is that every day can be filled with different artistic activities. Get your kids, parents, and siblings involved in the fun and make it a
      family activity to remember. </span></p>
  <h3><span id="13_Hiking">13. Hiking</span></h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appreciating the great outdoors is even more important during the pandemic, and hiking in the mountains with the wind blowing through your hair is incredibly freeing. Look into hiking trails near you and give it a
      go. </span></p>
  <h3><span id="14_Gardening">14. Gardening</span></h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gardening was a popular hobby before the pandemic, and it is even more of a popular hobby now! If you want a new gardening challenge, try growing your favorite plant or vegetable from seedlings. </span></p>
  <h3><span id="15_Cooking">15. Cooking</span></h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People who have never cooked before have turned into chefs and bakers during the pandemic. All of this free time has given people patience to make mistakes in the kitchen without feeling frustrated and giving up.
      Whether you follow recipes or wing it and make up your own, cooking sure is a fun new hobby! </span></p>
